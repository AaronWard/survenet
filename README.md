# survey-application
Survenet is an analysis tool built to replace certain approaches retailers undergo for measuring customer satisfaction, such as customer service emails or the HappyOrNot terminals. The application uses a trained neural network that is developed with the TensorFlow machine learning library.
The neural network was trained on a large dataset and is deployed as an API service for the proof-of-concept web application. The web application has facial detection capabilities to track a user face and take snapshots and show the their classified facial expressions on the fly, as opposed to questioning a personâ€™s experience at a store a few weeks later.
